- Weigths are equal to each other 
	Other dimensions of weigths looks unneccesery
	(In this example there is no unlinear process)
 
- Noise range is constant
  	(It could be adaptive !!)

- Tested with small number of inputs
	(How to convert sound data to test ?)

Small number of inputs are given to analyse the algorithm
It helped me to reach the insigths above
