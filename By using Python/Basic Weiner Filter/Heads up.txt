This was an attempt of testing very basic weiner filter 
on real audio data. The results of these tests are not 
sattisfactory. 

Filter used in this file adjust errors by simple 
differences and does not evaluate mean square.
Although I may considered the algorithm on very surface 
level it seemed the algorithm is unstable.
By the nature of this filter it is weigths are prone to 
converge to inifty I am guessing.

Similar weiner filter is also tested with matlab,
the results came out differently.

This file also helped me to understand the complexity of
sound data, and methods to investigate noise and sound.
