* The critical points to finish the algorithm is to
control initation. More specifically when there is not 
enough data to fill the array matrices.

+Solution: Just initate with delta*Identity
It is updated to suitble values after couple itterations

!Bad initation slows down the learning

* Some mathematical opperations seemed odd to me 
yet I didnt check 

	Check Sherman-Morrison formula -- (Inverse Update)


*Nonlinear noise -- What to do ??

*System identification checked , noise reduction incomplete
