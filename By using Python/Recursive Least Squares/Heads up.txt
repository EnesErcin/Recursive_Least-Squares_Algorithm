++ Carefully cheked every dimensions of eacy arrays
++ Added assertation command when seen neccesery

* The critical points to finish the algorithm is to
control initation. More specifically when there is not 
enough data to fill the array matrices.

* Some mathematical opperations seemed odd to me 
yet I didnt check 

	Check Sherman-Morrison formula -- (Inverse Update)
	Check different mathematical opperations to find 
	p[t] with A_t <--> Î£q[i]
	Check updating least square solution 
	calculate via update <--> calculate by knowing 
	beforehand

*Evaluate the result 
If the results are not giving any close estimate 
of the system than go through the algorithm again
